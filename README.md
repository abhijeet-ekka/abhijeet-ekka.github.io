# 👨‍💻 Abhijeet Ekka - 3D Interactive Portfolio

Hi there! 👋 I'm Abhijeet Ekka, a passionate frontend developer who loves creating immersive web experiences with 3D graphics and modern technologies.

This is my personal portfolio website that I built to showcase my skills and projects. It features a fully interactive 3D environment powered by Three.js, with particles, floating objects, and smooth animations.

## 🌟 What I Used to Build This

- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript** - The foundation of everything
- **Three.js** - For all the amazing 3D graphics
- **Google Fonts** - Orbitron and Inter for that perfect look
- **Lots of coffee and late nights** ☕

## 🎨 Key Features

### 3D Experience
- 1000+ animated particles that respond to your cursor
- 20+ floating geometric objects (cubes, spheres, toruses)
- Dynamic camera movements that change as you scroll
- Custom cursor with smooth trailing effects

### Visual Design
- Dark theme with neon cyan, purple, and pink accents
- Glassmorphism effects on all cards and UI elements
- Smooth animations and transitions throughout
- Fully responsive design that works on all devices

### Interactive Elements
- Smooth scrolling with section-based animations
- Skill bars that animate when you see them
- Project cards with hover effects
- Contact form with visual feedback
